Ready to start learning about UFO sightings? 

This code takes UFO data located in the data.js file and displays it to the html file. The data is is diplayed using the app.js file referenced in the html file. Also in the app.js file are 2 fucntions. The first creates the data table, the second fuction takes the user imput of the date and filters to only UFO sightings requested. 


Enjoy!
